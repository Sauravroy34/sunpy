A new property `.GenericMap.reference_date` has been added to decouple the reference date for the coordinate system from the "canonical" observation time.
This new property is now passed through to the map's WCS object as ``dateavg`` and is the time used for `.GenericMap.coordinate_frame` and `.GenericMap.observer_coordinate`.
